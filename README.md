# hked_model
Model of HKED instrument for safeguards R&D

This model was created as part of a PhD dissertation at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2015. It models the detector response of two low energy (x-ray) high purity germanium detectors to different concentrations of actinides in a hybrid K-edge densitometer.
